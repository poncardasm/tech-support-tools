# Slugify

Slugify is a simple web application that converts text into URL-friendly slugs by transforming it to lowercase and replacing spaces with hyphens (e.g., "Hello World" becomes "hello-world").

It provides a user-friendly interface with a textarea for input and a button to trigger the conversion.

The slugified text is automatically copied to the clipboard, and the button provides visual feedback upon successful conversion.
