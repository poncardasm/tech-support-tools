# Text Transformer

The "Text Transformer" is a simple web application that transforms text by converting it to lowercase and replacing spaces with hyphens.

It provides a user-friendly interface with a textarea for input and a button to trigger the conversion.

The transformed text is automatically copied to the clipboard, and the button provides visual feedback upon successful conversion.xw
